Guilded now officially supports Linux(Debian/Ubuntu).

[Download Official Client for Ubuntu](https://www.guilded.gg/downloads/Guilded-Linux.deb)


Guilded currently doesn't have a snap option, rpm, pacman, or any other options.

So, if you're using other distros like Arch, Fedora, etc you can run this command:

```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KorbsStudio/Guilded-for-Linux/master/installer.sh)
```
